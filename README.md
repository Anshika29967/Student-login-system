# Student Registration System

This project is a simple web-based Student Registration System. It allows users to add, edit, and delete student records while displaying them in a table format. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end, with local storage to persist data even after refreshing the page.

## Features
1. **Add New Student:** Users can add a new student record by filling out a form.
2. **Edit Existing Record:** Users can edit any existing student record directly from the table.
3. **Delete Student Record:** Users can delete a student record if it's no longer needed.
4. **Form Validation:** Ensures valid input before adding or updating records.
5. **Persistent Storage:** Uses local storage to save data, ensuring it persists across page refreshes.
6. **Scrollable Table:** If more than four records are present, the table becomes scrollable vertically.
7. **Responsive Design:** The interface is styled to look good on different screen sizes.

- `styles.css`: The CSS file used to style the form, table, and other elements.
